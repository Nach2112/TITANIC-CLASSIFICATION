# TITANIC-CLASSIFICATION
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, based on socio-economic and demographic factors. The goal is to analyze which features like gender, age, class, fare, and family status played the most important role in determining survival.
